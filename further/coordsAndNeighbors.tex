\indent\indent In the \textit{More} menu, you'll find the \textit{Recalculate Neighbors} and \textit{New Coordinates} options.\\
\newline
The \textit{Recalculate Neighbors} option is useful when you're using the \textit{Relative Neighbors Cleaning} tool. It allows you to re-calculate each marker neighbors when masks have been applied. You can chose how much neighbors for each marker, however, keep in mind that an important number of neighbors may significantly increase the processing time when calculating new coordinates or cleaning marker depending on relative neighbors. Between 10 and 40 neighbors seems to be a reasonnable value for analysis with 100 to 1000 markers per image.\\
\newline
The \textit{New Coordinates} option have been developped to re-calculate coordinates when new masks have been applied. It is only useful if you're interested in the 2D mapped plots (2D Strain, 2D correlation coefficient, ...). You can select the coordinates that you want to update. Depending on your number of images and markers, this can take some time, that's why we recommend to re-calculate only the data you're interested in (for example 2D strain).\\
